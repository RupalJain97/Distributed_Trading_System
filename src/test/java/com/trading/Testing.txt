For a comprehensive test suite for your **Distributed Stock Trading System**, you should include a variety of test types to ensure that all aspects of your system are working correctly. Here's a breakdown of important test cases you should consider:

### 1. **Unit Tests**
Unit tests focus on testing individual components, usually services or methods, to ensure they function as expected in isolation.

#### Suggested Unit Tests:
- **OrderService Tests**:
  - Test for placing a buy order (ensure stock quantity is reduced and order is recorded).
  - Test for placing a sell order (ensure stock quantity is increased and order is recorded).
  - Test behavior when a user tries to sell a stock they do not own.
  - Test the cache update logic (whether orders are batched and written to the DB every minute).
  
- **StockService Tests**:
  - Test retrieving stock information from the cache and DB.
  - Test updating stock quantities and prices.
  - Test clearing the stock cache and checking if it refreshes correctly after expiry.

- **UserService Tests**:
  - Test user registration and ensure that all necessary fields are filled.
  - Test login functionality, including correct password validation and session management.

#### Edge Case Unit Tests:
- Test placing a buy order for more stocks than are available.
- Test placing a sell order for more stocks than the user owns.
- Test placing an order for a non-existent stock.
- Test behavior if the database is unreachable or returns unexpected values.

### 2. **Integration Tests**
Integration tests ensure that different parts of the system work together as expected. These tests focus on the interaction between services, controllers, and the database.

#### Suggested Integration Tests:
- **End-to-End Buy/Sell Order Process**:
  - Place a buy order and verify if the stock is updated in both the cache and database.
  - Place a sell order and verify the stock updates accordingly, including changes in the user's stock holdings.
  
- **Cache Consistency**:
  - Test that the stock cache is updated correctly after an order is placed.
  - Ensure that the order cache is flushed to the database correctly and in the right time intervals (1 minute, as per the design).

- **Concurrency Tests**:
  - Test concurrent buy and sell orders to ensure data integrity (e.g., two users buying the same stock at the same time).
  - Simulate high-load scenarios with a large number of simultaneous buy/sell requests to ensure that thread pools are managing the requests effectively and stock data remains consistent.

- **Session Management**:
  - Test login functionality with multiple users logging in and placing orders at the same time.
  - Ensure that user session data (e.g., logged-in state, user ID) is handled correctly.

### 3. **Performance Tests**
Performance tests help measure how well the system performs under different conditions. Since this is a distributed trading system, it's crucial to understand how it behaves under load.

#### Suggested Performance Tests:
- **Thread Pool Capacity**:
  - Test performance with various thread pool sizes (e.g., 5, 10, 20 threads) and see how well the system handles increasing numbers of requests.
  
- **High Concurrency Load**:
  - Run tests that simulate many users placing buy and sell orders simultaneously (e.g., 50-100 users) and measure response times, thread utilization, and whether there is any thread starvation or deadlock.

- **Cache Performance**:
  - Measure the performance difference between serving requests from the cache vs. the database.
  - Test how long it takes for the cache to refill after being cleared (scheduled cache eviction).

### 4. **Database Integration Tests**
Database integration tests ensure that all database operations—such as queries, updates, and caching—are performed correctly.

#### Suggested Database Tests:
- **Order History Retrieval**:
  - Test retrieving order history for a user from the database.
  - Ensure the query for fetching distinct companies by user ID works correctly.

- **Data Integrity**:
  - Test that data is written correctly to the stock and order tables, even under high load.
  - Test for consistency between the cache and the database (i.e., after updating the cache, the database should reflect the correct state after the scheduled flush).

### 5. **Frontend/Backend Integration Tests**
Ensure the frontend works correctly with the backend REST APIs and renders the correct data dynamically.

#### Suggested Frontend Tests:
- **Stock Dashboard**:
  - Ensure the stock dashboard correctly fetches data from the `/stocks` endpoint and updates dynamically.
  - Test the polling mechanism to ensure the stock table is updated in real-time without affecting ongoing user actions (e.g., placing orders).

- **Order Placement**:
  - Simulate a user placing a buy/sell order through the frontend and verify that the correct data is sent to the backend and reflected in the system.

### 6. **Security Tests**
Ensure that the system is secure and doesn't expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized actions.

#### Suggested Security Tests:
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Test that unauthorized users cannot place buy/sell orders.
  - Test session expiry and user logout scenarios to ensure no unauthorized access.

- **SQL Injection Protection**:
  - Attempt SQL injection attacks on endpoints that interact with the database to ensure they are handled properly.

### 7. **Stress Tests**
Stress tests focus on pushing the system beyond its normal operational capacity to find breaking points.

#### Suggested Stress Tests:
- **High Volume Orders**:
  - Simulate thousands of buy/sell orders and measure how well the system can handle the load.
  
- **Stock Lookup**:
  - Stress test the stock lookup service by simulating many users checking stock availability simultaneously.

### 8. **Error Handling Tests**
Test how the system handles various error conditions to ensure that it fails gracefully.

#### Suggested Error Handling Tests:
- **Database Unavailability**:
  - Simulate a database failure and check how the application responds to ensure there are proper retries or error responses.

- **Cache Eviction**:
  - Simulate cache eviction and ensure that the system correctly reloads data from the database.

By implementing these tests, you will ensure that your distributed trading system is robust, performant, and scalable, even under concurrent loads.
